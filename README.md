# Survey form

### A survey form done using html and css.

The survey form asks a few questions ranging from personal questions to how you feel about freecodecamp and what would you want to improve. The aim of this is to use and showcase the different types of form labels and inputs that can be used in websites.

The project includes index.html and styles.css files, running the index.html file will start the form.

*This was done as part of the freecodecamp web design course, and is the first project.*
